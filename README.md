# Summary of this project

This project is a complex backend project built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and many more. This project has all the features that a backend project should have. I am developing a complete video hosting website, similar to YouTube, with features including login, signup, video uploading, liking, disliking, commenting, replying, subscribing, unsubscribing, and many more.


Employing industry-standard practices like JWT for secure authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and a system of access and refresh tokens, this project adheres to best practices in backend development.
